********************** vibRate **********************

You essential task is to listen to a vibrato (using a pure sine tone) first. While listening to the vibrato you should strive to inner hear what the central pitch around which the vibrato is happening. After the test tone stops, you will use a slider which controls the frequency of a straight tone sine oscillator to match the pitch than you inner hear. 

You will be listening to 90 samples in total. The first 10 samples are non-vibrato tones meant for calibration purposes. After the 90th sample is played a pop-up dialog box will appear and then you will save you data as a text file. 

The text files should be emailed to deg3@gatech.edu.

*********** Possible issues ******************

We are aware that the user interface is not completely robust. Everything will be smooth if you are careful about the experiment flow. If you happen to hit "stop button" twice you might hear the tone being played again, in which case continue hitting the stop button till the tone stops. 

Take your time and be careful about the steps required to perform the experiment. 

Enjoy!
